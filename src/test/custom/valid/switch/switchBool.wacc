# a simple switch statement processing bool type
# It's not recommended to put a bool variable in the switch statement
# as the code is not elegant. Simply use if-else in this scenario
# However, we choose to support it anyway

# Output:
# Correct!

# Program:

begin
  bool b = false;
  string content = "";
  switch b do
    case true
      content = "Incorrect!";
      break
    case false
      content = "Correct!";
      break
    default
      content = "Should not print this line"
  done;

  print content
end
