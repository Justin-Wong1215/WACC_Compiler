# simple for-loop using a predefined variable as the first statement
# in the for-loop, i.e. the variable i is declared before the for-loop

# Output:
# 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

# Program:

begin
  int i = 0;
  for (i = 0; i < 10; i = i + 1) do
    print i;
    print ", "
  done;
  println i
end
